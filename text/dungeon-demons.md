### Dungeon Demons

Dungeon Demons is a browser game written in Rust compiled to WebAssembly.
The game uses the WebGL and WebAudio APIs to provide high performance gameplay even on mobile.
Dungeon Demons features infinite, procedural terrain generation and endless waves of enemies which can be defeated with a variety of weapons.

Although Dungeon Demons is best played on desktops, the website also works on mobile.
This is facilitated through a custom joystick built using the Touch API.
