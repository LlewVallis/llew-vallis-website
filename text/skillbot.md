### Skillbot

Skillbot is a rating system capable of calculating player rankings for any team game, from chess, to soccer and everything in between.
Under the hood, it makes use of the Trueskill rating system, backed by a Postgres database to store match and player data reliably.

Skillbot integrates into Discord to provide a helpful user experience and has been used in practice by people seeking to set up their own communities.
