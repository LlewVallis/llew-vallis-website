### Skillbot

Skillbot is a fairly minimal rating system capable of calculating player rankings for arbirary two team games.
Under the hood, it uses the [Trueskill](https://trueskill.org/) rating system and stores player and match data in a Postgres database.

Skillbot is fairly small application, but I used it as a foundation for learning Spring Boot, Spring Data, and database connectivity.
