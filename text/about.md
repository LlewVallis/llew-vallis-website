Hi, my name's Llew Vallis, and ever since deciding to dive into Java way back in 2014, I've been enthralled in the world of software development.
I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Queensland in Australia, expecting to graduate in 2023.

I love writing both backend and frontend code using a variety of tools and languages.
On the server, I'm experienced in Java, Kotlin, Rust, and Spring, and on the frontend side of things, I'm at my best using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
I also love to learn new languages and tools on the regular, I've most notably also used Python, Scala, and Elixir, but I've dabbled in several other languages and frequently read about concepts from even more.
I find that expanding my knowledge with technologies I'm unaccustomed to pushes my skills with the tools I use regularly.
In fact, this website was made with GatsbyJS and Sass; two technologies I haven't mentioned prior.

As far as tooling goes, I know all the usual suspects: Docker, Git, Linux, Vim, VSCode, and IntelliJ.
I have no problem working with servers remotely with nothing but a shell.
In terms of databases, I'm familiar with Postgres and MongoDB.

I'm fascinated by cutting-edge programming language design and have dabbled with parsing, program transformation, JVM bytecode, and LLVM. Modern programming techniques and robust type systems are of special interest to me; so I love reading up on the ins and outs of the theory of the languages I use and in some I don't.
