Hi, my name's Llew Vallis, and ever since deciding to dive into Java way back in 2014, I've been enthralled in the world of software development.
I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Queensland in Australia, expecting to graduate in 2023.
Whilst studying, I've received the Dean's Commendation for Academic Excellence and the Professor Stanley Castlehow Bursury at King's college.
I am also currently doing some tutoring work at King's.

Software development is my passion, and I love reading and watching talks to hone my skills.
I enjoy working with a spectrum of programming languages, including functional and low-level imperative programming.
I'm comfortable with both purely functional higher-order functions and low-level concurrent code with atomics.

My dream is to work somewhere that will enable me to become the best I can be at programming and with people I can learn from and share my knowledge with.
