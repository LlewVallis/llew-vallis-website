### Ludum Dare

Ludum Dare is a programming competition in which each team is given 72 hours to make a game from scratch based on a previously unseen theme.
It gets pretty hectic, but me and a friend threw our hat in the ring a few times and came up with some fun games.

Unlike most teams, none of our submissions used a game engine, meaning I got down in the weeds with graphics programming a fair bit.
Two of our games ran on OpenGL and other used Java's built in Graphics2D.
Since everything was implemented ground up, the games aren't terribly cross platform, but if you do want to give one a whirl [Discharge](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/discharge) is the most likely to work on operating systems other than Windows, despite being the least impressive of the bunch.

Unfortunately, since all of this was a number of years ago, the source code is long lost.
There is a brief description of each game at the link below though.
